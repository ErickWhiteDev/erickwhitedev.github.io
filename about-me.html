          Hello! I am <span class="stylized"><b>Erick White</b></span>, an undergraduate aerospace engineering major with focuses in aerospace computing and numerical methods.
          My main interests lie in astrodynamics and interplanetary mission design (in the astronautics field) and hypersonic physics and vehicle design (in the aeronautics and astronautics fields), although I am always open to exploring more fields of aerospace engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics.
          I am dedicated to using my engineering education to influence change and drive forward human scientific innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience thus far lies mainly in software development. As an intern for the <a class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/conjunction-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA CARA</a> (Conjunction Assessment and Risk Analysis) program, I worked with both existing code (unit testing, implementing edge case checks, code robustness, <em>etc.</em>) and new research code I developed myself (all of which was done in MATLAB).
          Having just completed my sophomore year, I have taken a variety of classes in aerospace engineering disciplines and for my two minors, computer science and applied mathematics; together, the skills I have gained from these have given me some of the necessary insight to work in both academic and industry environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my key strengths is my ability to work in a team, both as a leader and as a follower.
          When I am put in charge of a team, I am very effective at ensuring that work gets done and that all team members are heard; my feedback from my peers regarding my leadership abilities has been overwhelmingly positive, and I am often the one to assume leadership roles when no one else stands up to do so.
          Additionally, my experience as a recitation leader for the <a href="https://cuengineeringhonors.com/" class="link">University of Colorado Boulder Engineering Honors Program</a> has been valuable in teaching me how to teach and communicate effectively in small groups, a critical skill in any workplace.
          As a follower, I am always sure to communicate my progress, questions, and doubts to ensure an effective and efficient work environment; I am not hesitant to ask questions if I believe they need answering.
          Additionally, I always offer myself to help others in team environments, as I believe a team can only work effectively if all of its members understand what is happening and how to move forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following my undergraduate education, I am looking to pursue graduate school (a Master's at minimum, and likely a doctoral degree subsequently); I am particularly interested in conducting research, as I believe it is critical to advancing science and technology for the betterment of humanity.
          I am hoping to explore various aspects of the aerospace industry, but ultimately plan to work in the field of interplanetary mission design; however, this may change as my education continues, and I am always open to learning new things.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you believe I would be a good fit for your position, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at <a class="link" href="mailto:erickwhitebusiness@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erickwhitebusiness@gmail.com</a> or using the <a class="link" href="#contact-form">contact form</a> at the bottom of this website.
          I am currently looking for any opportunities in the summer of 2025 or beyond.
