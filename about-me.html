                <h3>A Little Bit of History</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born in Florida, but as part of a military family, I moved around often; I lived in two different places in Florida before moving to Italy, two more places in Germany, and finally Colorado.
                    I've visited many places on top of those, including both within the states and outside.

                <div class="hidden" id="history-hidden">
                    <p>
                        In both travelling and living in a variety of places, I've gotten to meet a huge variety of people and cultures; however, Italy and Colorado are still closest to my heart.
                        I have family all over the place - from big Texas cities to rural northern Italian towns that don't even have a high school - so I'm proud of my background. I also speak fluent Italian, am semi-fluent in Spanish, and am very interested in learning more languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I moved to Colorado in 2011 and have lived here ever since; I'm now attending <a class="link" href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">CU Boulder</a> for aerospace engineering, so I'm here to stay for at least a little longer.
                        My interest in STEM started very young (I remember observing Jupiter and its Galilean moons from my backyard in Germany with a tiny refractor) and has stayed with me ever since; I'm so glad to finally be taking the next steps in exploring my interests.

                <h3>Organizations I've Been Involved With</h3>
                <p>
                    Both in and out of school, I've been involved with a great variety of organizations. When I was in high school, I was the president of my school's branch of the National Honor Society; before I became president, however, I created the branch's personal website and helped maintain it as a place where members could come find important documents, events, and more.
                    I also was the president of my school's Aerospace Club, as well as Team Captain for our Science Olympiad team; as part of Science Olympiad, I reached fifth place in the state in the astronomy category, and my senior year was the first time my school had gone to state in a long time.
                    Currently, I'm the Outreach Lead of my university's astronomy club, a role which lets me help others continue to find the beauty in the night sky and in learning about astronomy.

                        Outside of school, I am involved with several organizations, but the one I have been involved with for the longest (and done the most with) is the <a class="link" href="https://csastro.org" target="_blank">Colorado Springs Astronomical Society</a>.
                        As part of this organization, I have been involved in a variety of STEM-related outreach, including star parties (events where I bring my telescope out to the public and allow them to use it while explaining what they're seeing), events and demonstrations for <a class="link" href="https://www.astroleague.org/astronomyday/facts" target="_blank">Astronomy Day</a>, presentations, and more.
                        As one of the youngest members of the astronomical society, I was often involved in outreach involving younger students, and was the Kid's Event Coordinator at <a class="link" href="https://rmss.org" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Star Stare</a> as well.
                        At RMSS, I also set up my telescope outside the main building and often have a small crowd come to observe through it on clear nights.
                        I have received the Night Sky Network outreach award twice for my work in astronomical outreach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also volunteered extensively with the <a class="link" href="https://blackeducatorsnetwork.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Black Educator's Network</a> at several events, including book fairs and their yearly Literacy Festival, at which I have given presentations for several years; these have included a hands-on demo of crater formation, and introductory course on Python 3, and a keynote presentation on the importance of perseverance for success.

                <h3>My Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    I've worked on a variety of projects throughout the years, but there are some I'm especially proud of - particularly relating to STEM.
                    For several years, I participated in an event called the <a class="link" href="https://www.conradchallenge.org/" target="_blank">Conrad Challenge</a>: an international innovation competition in which teams have to identify a problem across a variety of categories (aerospace, environmental, cyber, etc., plus a few "special" categories every year).
                    As part of the project, participants have to conduct a lot of research on aspects such as current attempts at resolving the issue, the impact of their solution, the cost of the solution, and much more; teams must also create a full business plan, complete with market analysis and a product pitch video.
                    I competed in the Conrad Challenge for three years, once in the aerospace category, once in the special category for cleaning the oceans, and once in the environmental category with a project that tied into the aerospace industry; I competed in a team of two for all three years (twice with the same teammate).
                    The first year, my teammate and I decided to tackle the issue of airborne pollutants, particularly from airplanes; we wanted to devise a method for creating a safe, sustainable airplane fuel using carbon capture from the atmosphere.
                    Over the course of our project, my teammate and I honed in on an effective method for removing pollutants from the atmosphere and turning them into an efficient and effective airplane fuel; our project, "From Gas to Gas: Emission-Based Fuels" placed seventh in the world our of over thirty teams, and we were chosen to be alternate finalists.

                        I also regularly attend an event called <a class="link" href="https://rmss.org" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Star Stare</a>, a five-day world-class astronomy convention held yearly in June (or early July, depending on when the new Moon is).
                        A large portion of this event is the featured speakers, which has included highly influential and important figures in science such as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Bagenal" target="_blank">Dr. Fran Bagenal</a>, who worked on both the New Horizons and Juno missions, as well as a variety of others, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt" target="_blank">Dr. Harrison Schmitt</a>, a geologist one of the last people to walk on the Moon, and <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/pranverahyseni?lang=en" target="_blank">Pranvera Hyseni</a>, founder of Astronomy Outreach of Kosovo, the only such program in the entire country.
                        As part of its presentations, the event directors chose to add one presentation each year by a youth (under 18) speaker, called the Jim West Memorial Youth in Science Lecture (named after the former president of the <a class="link" href="https://csastro.org" target="_blank">Colorado Springs Astronomical Society</a>.
                        I was chosen to be the first youth speaker for this event (and had actually already given one presentation at the event prior to the founding of the specific lecture program); I gave a presentation titled "Measuring the Atmospheric Methane Levels of Uranus and Neptune."
                        As the title suggests, I (with the generous help of Scott Donnell, the president at the time of the astronomical society who taught me and allowed me to use his equipment) carried out spectroscopic analysis on Uranus and Neptune to determine the relative intensities of methane in their atmospheres and the effect on their visual appearances, particularly the color.
                        I compiled and analyzed my results earlier in the year, then made the data easily presentable and understandable for RMSS; the presentation was extremely well received.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At university, I now compete in the <a class="link" href="https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling</a>, an international competition in which thousands of teams from around the world are provided prompts from which to choose and develop a mathematical model to solve a (usually) real-world problem.
                        In my first year of competing, my team of three developed a mathematical model for gauging the effectiveness and importance of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, ultimately settling on a complete undirected weighted graph model for which we received an Honorable Mention.

                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    During my free time, I have a variety of hobbies I enjoy.
                    I love hiking, biking, and rock climbing (especially bouldering) - lucky for me, I live in Colorado, where I have plenty of opportunities to do all of these things!
                    I have some wonderful biking trails near where I live, and some good friends whom I enjoy bouldering with when I can.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        I also greatly enjoy photography (photo gallery coming soon) - especially nature photography! I frequently run into the problem of running out of storage from how many photos I take; I once took over 1500 on a just nine-day trip!
                        Some of my best photos are ones I've taken at Cinque Terre, some nice nature photography I've gotten while camping, and good photos of lunar eclipses through my telescope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of my telescope, I also really enjoy astronomy - it's what really got me interested in STEM in the first place, and I still enjoy it to this day.
                        I've spent a long time learning to starhop and find targets by hand - my telescope <em>technically</em> has a push-to computer, but I've never gotten it to work. Besides, I like the challenge of finding objects on my own.
                        I particularly enjoy finding deep-sky objects, such as nebulae and galaxies; some of my favorite to see are the Western Veil Nebula in Cygnus (especially through an OIII filter in really dark skies), M51 (the Whirlpool Galaxy), and M57 (the Ring Nebula, because it's the first deep-sky object I learned how to find).
                        My first non-naked-eye comet was C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) in June of 2022; at around magnitude 8.8 when I saw it, it wasn't too horribly dim, but it definitely didn't stand out either - I'm really proud I found it!
                        Someday, I hope to complete the Messier Marathon (finding every object on the Messier catalog in one night), but for now, I'll stick with finding them in general - I've already seen quite a decent number of them.
                        I also really enjoy observing with friends, and I've made some of my closest friends through astronomy events.
