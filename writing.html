        <h3><em>Analyzing and Solving the N-Body Problem</em></h3>
        <p>
          Following my numerical analysis class, I decided to also take numerical differential equations - and, similar to numerical analysis, it, too, had a final project that involved building on a topic we covered in class.
          I teamed up with <a class="link" href="https://edward.wawrzynek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Wawrzynek</a> again, as well as
          <a class="link" href="https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/brycepfuetze/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryce Pfuetze</a>, and we decided to tackle the <em>N</em>-body problem, a common problem across engineering and physics fields.
          Specifically, since this problem has no analytical solution, we decided to focus on understanding and tackling the inherent stiffness in the problem; we also studied symplectic integrators and their useful energy-conservation properties.
          We compared our own implementations of the Euler, RK2, RK4, and Stormer-Verlet methods and studied energy error over time; we also compared integrated ephemerides to those given by the JPL Horizons database.
          This work led directly into my <a class="link" href="work-and-experience.html#csml-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">work at the Celestial and Spaceflight Mechanics Laboratory</a>.

          <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madison-p-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Jones</a>, and I decided to compete in a mathematical modeling competition - this time, in the
          <a class="link" href="https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a>, a more math-heavy variant of the
          <a class="link" href="writing.html#icm-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling</a> we partook in in 2023.
          This year, we chose a problem focused on modeling wear on stairs, and using such wear patterns to inform archaeologists to the age of the stairs, their usage patterns, and other quantities that could be derived only from non-destructive measurements of the steps.
          We chose to approach this by constructing an empirical distribution of footfalls on the stairs; from this distribution (we used a Gaussian mixtured model), we backed out values such as the means and covariances of the Gaussians which we then used to back out properties related to the age and usage of the stairs.
          We again won an Honorable Mention for our work.

        <h3><em>Derivations and Applications of the Discrete, Fast, and Short-Time Fourier Transforms</em></h3>
        <p>
          My numerical analysis class included a final project that built on a topic we covered and presented results we had not previously discussed.
          I teamed up with two of my friends from the <a class="link" href="https://cuengineeringhonors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering Honors Program</a> and we decided to study further the Fourier transform - an important tool in signal processing, electronics, and many other fields.
          As part of <a class="link" href="work-and-experience.html#lair-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my work with the LAIR lab</a>, I had been exposed to the short-time Fourier transform, a tool used for generating spectrograms of time-varying signals; we utilized this knowledge, as well as
          <a class="link" href="https://edward.wawrzynek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Wawrzynek's</a> experience working with frequency domain analysis, to explore the use cases of the discrete, fast, and short-time Fourier transforms.
          We used several real-life datasets in this study as well, studying both patterns in weather around Boulder, Colorado and attempting to visualize some of the same EMIC waves I was studying in my research!

        <h3><em>Design Proposal for Crewed Interplanetary Mission</em></h3>
        <p>
          As part of my Introduction to Human Spaceflight Class under former NASA astronaut Jim Voss, I wrote a report detailing a living module and Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) for a hypothetical crewed mission to Mars.
          This report involved analyzing existing ECLSS technologies, deciding which were best fit for the mission, conducting research on them, and explaining how they would be implemented in this mission.
          Also included in the report is a concept of operations (CONOPS) and interior and exterior views of the living module.

        <p>
          My partner <a class="link" href="https://sites.google.com/view/audrarissmeyer/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audra Rissmeyer</a> and I wrote this paper as our final report for our applied matrix methods class.
          The paper explored the concepts of observational covariance matrices, transformations between celestial
          coordinate systems, and transformations of covariance matrices (and why these transformations would be done).
          We used MATLAB functions provided by NASA CARA to run the transformations discussed in Alfano and Vallado’s
          <em>Updated Analytical Partials for Covariance Transformations and Optimization</em> and illustrated covariance
          through our own MATLAB visualizations. We also illustrated the difference between Cartesian and equinoctial
          covariance distributions and briefly explained the significance that these distributions have.

          As a member of a team of three, I participated in the <a class="link" href="https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling</a>, a yearly competition in which thousands of teams around the world pick one problem out of three (or a separate set of three for the closely-related Mathematical Contest in Modeling), research the problem, develop a model to represent the situation at hand, and write a paper with their results, all over the span of only 100 hours.
          This year, my team tackled a problem regarding the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and how to best prioritize them to create the most beneficial change over the next decade.
          The paper won an Honorable Mention, meaning it was in the top 30% of papers submitted for that particular problem; we also presented this paper at the
