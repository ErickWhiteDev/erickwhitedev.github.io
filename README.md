# My Portfolio

### Hi, I'm Erick White - student, programmer, explorer.
I'm an aerospace engineering major at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/), currently in my freshman year.
I've been interested in computer science for a long time (I started coding in Scratch)
when I was in elementary school, and finally moved on to Python, Java, and other languages
in high school); I hope to be able to pursue my interest through a possible minor in computer science.

## This is a portfolio of my various projects, coding challenges, and assignments, across multiple years and programming languages.

### More details on any project are available on request, along with additional projects.
### Check out my [website](https://erickwhitedev.github.io/portfolio/) for more information!
### **NOTE:** This site was largely developed and tested using Chrome on Windows 10 machines, and thus may have some issues on other browsers (particularly mobile) - I'll get these fixed as soon as I can!

# About Me

### I am a student with a passion for many STEM topics, especially those related to aerospace and computer science fields.
### I enjoy coding as a hobby, and have taken every chance I can get to enroll in computer science classes and learn more.

## What will you find in this portfolio?

### This portfolio is a compilation of a variety of different projects and assignments from over the years.
### It invludes both finished and unfinished projects in many langiages; see my pages for [Java](https://erickwhitedev.github.io/portfolio/website/pages/java.html) and [Python](https://erickwhitedev.github.io/portfolio/website/pages/python.html) for a few examples of this.

## Where is this portfolio headed?

### I am planning on consistently updating this repository; make sure to check back often! In the meanwhile, here's a short "to-do" list (in no particular order):

- Adding dates to all my projects
- Adding my C# (Unity) projects to my website
- Improving my website's design
- Finishing/adding more programming challenges

### Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
