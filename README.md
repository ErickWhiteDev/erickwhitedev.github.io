# My Portfolio

### Hi, I'm Erick White - student, innovator, explorer.
### Check out my [website](https://erickwhitedev.github.io) for more information!

<br>

I'm an aerospace engineering major at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/), currently in my freshman year.
I've been interested in computer science for a long time (I started coding in Scratch 
when I was in elementary school, moved on to Python, Java, and other languages in high school, 
and now code primarily in MATLAB and C++);
I continue pursue my interest in programming through a minor in computer science.

## Where is this website headed?

### I am planning on consistently updating this repository; make sure to check back often! In the meanwhile, here's a short "to-do" list (in no particular order):

- Adding more content pages
- Adding relevant images
- Adding submenus and subpages for particular interests and projects
