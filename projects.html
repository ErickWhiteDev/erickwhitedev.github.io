                <h3>Solid-Liquid Hybrid Rocket Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my <a class="link" href="relevant-courses.html#asen-1403">Introduction to Rocket Engineering</a> class, my team modeled, made design choices for, and fired off a solid-liquid hybrid rocket engine.
                    This project involved learning the basics of the physics behind how rocket engines work, an introduction to evaluating differential equations in Excel using Euler's method, and an introduction to engineering design and making choices within constraints.

                    <p>
                        This was the major final project for the course, taking several months to develop the model, make design choices, and pass various checkpoints along the way.
                        One of the major checkpoints was the cold-flow test, in which the team did a test of the oxidizer tank flow rate to further increase the accuracy of our models.
                        The other major checkpoint was the hot-fire test, in which the engine was fired with everything in place (fuel core, oxidizer, full assembly). This was the culmination of the hands-on portion of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the data from the tests to reflect on the accuracy of the model, the team was able to compare theoretical vs. real-world conditions and draw conclusions from the results, as well as learn how to improve future models.
                    </p>

                <h3>Estes Rocket With Data Acquisition System</h3>
                <p>
                    Another project for my <a class="link" href="relevant-courses.html#asen-1403">Introduction to Rocket Engineering</a> class, this was a largely-solo project that involved learning the basics of data acquisition and processing.
                    Using an Arduino Nano and a hand-soldered circuit board, I was able to predict the trajectory of a model rocket and then compare this to real data from the flight gathered using my DAQ.

                <h3>COMAP ICM 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    As a member of a team of three, I participated in the <a class="link" href="https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html">Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling</a>, a yearly competition in which thousands of teams around the world pick one problem out of three (or a separate set of three for the closely-related Mathematical Contest in Modeling), research the problem, develop a model to represent the situation at hand, and write a paper with their results, all over the span of only 100 hours.
                    This year, my team tackled a problem regarding the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and how to best prioritize them to create the most beneficial change over the next decade.
                    The paper won an Honorable Mention, meaning it was in the top 30% of papers submitted for that particular problem.
