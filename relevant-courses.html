            <p>
              This class explored ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and how the two can be used in
              tandem to solve complex systems and real-life problems.
              Throughout this class, I worked in a team of three on two projects that allowed us to apply what we
              had learned to real-life engineering problems, such as calculating the deflection of a beam in a
              bridge and determining the evolution of an ecosystem over time.
              These projects made heavy use of MATLAB, both to calculate and to visualize results.

            <h3 class="stylized">ASEN 2012 - Experimental and Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering Sciences</h3>
            <p>
              This class used a variety of experimental and computational methods to explore how problems are
              solved in real-world aerospace engineering.
              Topics covered included numerical integration, error analysis, experimental design, root finding,
              and engineering ethics.
              The class also involved two large projects, each of which combined a variety of subjects learned
              into one large, real-life example.
              The first project involved extrapolating the positions of two satellites into the future using
              least-squares regression with matrix calculations and then determining whether the two satellites
              would collide or if a warning needed to be issued.
              The second project was a trajectory calculation where a four-dimensional parameter space was used
              to find a launch configuration for a bottle rocket that would land it within one meter of a target zone.

            <h3 class="stylized">CSCI 2270 - Data Structures</h3>
            <p>
              This class covered a variety of commonly-utilized data structures in computer science, including
              binary search trees, red black trees, graphs, hash tables, and several more.
              Throughout the course, I utilized these data structures to tackle a variety of problems and see
              how each data structure could be utilized in practice.
              The course culminated with a search engine project making use of a hash table and a skip list
              to store and access data about IMDB's top movies and directors.

            <h3 class="stylized">CSCI 2400 - Computer Systems</h3>
            <p>
              This class was an introduction to low-level computer functionality and design.
              It began with a discussion of how programs work at a low level (including binary representations of data,
              assembly language, and an explanation of the heap) and then explored the design of computers themselves
              through topics such as RAM and virtual memory.

            <p>
              This class provided a background to and exploration of various uses of linear algebra. It covered the
              fundamental concepts of the field of linear algebra and then covered various common real-life uses,
              including least-squares regression and data fitting, interpolating polynomials, and principal component
              analysis. It also covered a wide range of decompositions and problem-solving methods used to solve
              engineering problems, with a particular focus on eigenvalue/eigenvector decompositions.

            <p>
              This class was an introduction to various aspects of discrete mathematics and their applications. Topics
              included combinatorics, logical propositions and connectives, algorithms and complexities, and introductory
              graph theory. Additionally, it provided an introductory background to set theory and its uses.

            <p>
              This class was a freshman-year introduction to the field of aerospace engineering.
              Through the use of both individual and group projects, it taught engineering design principles while
              also teaching basic modeling and prediction, culminating in the prediction (using Euler's method for
              differential equations), testing, and analyzing a solid-liquid hybrid engine; the engine had several
              variables decided upon by the team (fuel grain design, oxidizer chamber pressurization, nozzle throat

            <p>
              This class was an introduction to both thermodynamics and aerodynamics.
              The thermodynamics portion of the class covered the zeroth and first laws of thermodynamics, going in
              depth into both closed and opening systems and investigating common engineering problems through the
              lens of thermodynamics. The aerodynamics portion of the class covered both aerodynamics theory (inviscid
              and viscid flow across blunt bodies, flat plates, and thin airfoils) and practical applications (reading
              NACA airfoil data, determining lift and drag for a given airfoil, scaling experiments using dynamic
              similarity and nondimensional coefficients).
