        <h3 class="stylized">ASEN 1403 - Introduction to Rocket Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          This class was a freshman-year introduction to the field of aerospace engineering.
          Through the use of both individual and group projects, it taught engineering design principles while
          also teaching basic modeling and prediction, culminating in the prediction (using Euler's method for
          differential equations), testing, and analyzing a solid-liquid hybrid engine; the engine had several
          variables decided upon by the team (fuel grain design, oxidizer chamber pressurization, nozzle throat
          diameter, injector plate design), and the test fire was run entirely by the team.

        <h3 class="stylized">APPM 2360 - Introduction to Differential Equations with Linear Algebra</h3>
        <p>
          This class explored ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and how the two can be used in
          tandem to solve complex systems and real-life problems.
          Throughout this class, I worked in a team of three on two projects that allowed us to apply what we
          had learned to real-life engineering problems, such as calculating the deflection of a beam in a
          bridge and determining the evolution of an ecosystem over time.
          These projects made heavy use of MATLAB, both to calculate and to visualize results.

      <article class="container light" id="asen-2012">
        <h3 class="stylized">ASEN 2012 - Experimental and Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering Sciences</h3>
        <p>
          This class used a variety of experimental and computational methods to explore how problems are
          solved in real-world aerospace engineering.
          Topics covered included numerical integration, error analysis, experimental design, root finding,
          and engineering ethics.
          The class also involved two large projects, each of which combined a variety of subjects learned
          into one large, real-life example.
          The first project involved extrapolating the positions of two satellites into the future using
          least-squares regression with matrix calculations and then determining whether the two satellites
          would collide or if a warning needed to be issued.
          The second project was a trajectory calculation where a four-dimensional parameter space was used
          to find a launch configuration for a bottle rocket that would land it within one meter of a target zone.

        <h3 class="stylized">CSCI 2270 - Data Structures</h3>
        <p>
          This class covered a variety of commonly-utilized data structures in computer science, including
          binary search trees, red black trees, graphs, hash tables, and several more.
          Throughout the course, I utilized these data structures to tackle a variety of problems and see
          how each data structure could be utilized in practice.
          The course culminated with a search engine project making use of a hash table and a skip list
          to store and access data about IMDB's top movies and directors.
