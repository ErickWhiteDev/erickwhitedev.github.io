                    Education, far from only being a means by which to acquire knowledge, is instead a method by which individuals can gain an appreciation for both the knowledge they already have and the knowledge they are yet to acquire. University education should be a particularly potent case of this: ideally, everyone who enters university is doing so out of personal interest and passion for a given subject, and therefore stands only to gain from such an education. University should not provide only direct information, but instead should provide the tools to utilize what one learns in an environment conducive to furthering collective knowledge. In this case, “collective knowledge” is not necessarily collective in the sense of all of humanity’s sum knowledge; quite evidently, almost no college freshman will be making groundbreaking discoveries that push humanity to new frontiers. Instead, this collective knowledge is relative to the individual and those with whom the individual associates; if one can apply knowledge and methods gained from university to even a small team or cause, then the educational process has been a success. In this light, education must not focus solely on cramming as many facts as possible into a period of a couple of years; instead, it must focus on ensuring that those who wish to focus on and specialize in one topic (or several related ones) have the tools and capacity to utilize this knowledge to further society as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The burden of education is not wholly on the provider, however, but depends instead much on the individual. It is the role of the individual to make a “bigger picture” from the smaller facts and components, as well as to utilize what one learns in an effective manner; effort and integrity cannot be taught. Instead, one must approach education (particularly higher education) with the idea that what is provided directly will not be everything that can be gained; rather, to make full use of the potential of education, one must be willing to put forward at least as much effort as those teaching and providing the tools and knowledge in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value of education, similarly to its purpose, comes in the benefit it provides to society; the more educated individuals a society has, the further that society can progress. This follows simply from the fact that a more educated population has the means by which to not only provide for itself, but to realize the shortcomings of the present and adapt the methods and values of the time to pave the way for a better future; the same foresight and predictive power that gives humans an evolutionary edge over other animals can be expanded through education to benefit societies on a much grander scale. Education has little value if it is restricted to the few upper individuals of society; a majority of its value comes instead through its widespread application by people of all backgrounds. Knowledge alone provides no benefit without a group of people to interpret and apply it, and therefore, education cannot solely provide knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding my university education in particular, I hope to gain from it a newfound appreciation for the ideas and concepts I already understand, a better understanding of how to apply what I know, and the tools to continue learning long after my formal education has finished. The classroom doorway is no place for learning to end, but neither is a graduation ceremony. I plan to approach my college education with the perspective that I will never fully learn everything I know; there will always be unexplored depths, connections, and applications that I will be unaware of. However, university will allow me to acquire the tools to find these deeper meanings later, long after I have graduated, and apply them to my place in the world.
