                <p>
                    I returned to <a class="link" href="https://www.omitron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omitron</a> for a second summer, this time in a research position on the <a class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/conjunction-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CARA</a> (Conjunction Assessment and Risk Analysis) team.
                    Since I was a returning intern, I had the opportunity to felve much more deeply into more complex topics than I was able to during my previous summer; during my work, I was exposed to advanced concepts in conjunction assessment, such as covariance estimation and propagation, covariance realism, multivariate statistical analysis, and multidimensional data visualization.
                    The majority of my work was on a research project building on the work I did at the end of my previous internship, this time focusing on comparing three methods for visualizing near-Earth satellite conjunctions and their utility for different conjunction geometries; as a part of this research, I both developed a visualization program and wrote a 26-page paper on my work and findings.

                        In addition to my main research project, I also had the opportunity to work on several other projects, including a statistical corner plot generator for MATLAB, a conjunction update visualizer, and an experimental numerical propagator for simulating deep-space conjunctions using simplified equations of motion.
                        I also had the opportunity to present by work to both the CARA Analysis Team and a broader group of engineers, researchers, and interns at the end of the summer.
                        The paper I wrote is currently going through the NASA review process to hopefully be brought to a conference in summer of 2025.

                <h3 class="stylized">Omitron Internship - NASA CARA (June 2023 - August 2023)</h3>
                <p>
                    I was an analysis intern for <a class="link" href="https://www.omitron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omitron</a>, a NASA contractor, on the <a class="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/conjunction-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CARA</a> (Conjunction Assessment and Risk Analysis) program.
                    For the first portion of my internship, I primarily worked on updating and developing unit tests for various routines in the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/nasa/CARA_Analysis_Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CARA SDK</a>, as well as improving the safety and robustness of some of these routines.
                    These included both simple library functions and more complicated, in-depth research-driven code, such as the code used to calculate probability of collision (Pc) using various semi-analytical and numerical methods.
                    During the final three weeks (approximately) of my internship, I was put to the task of developing my own tool from scratch.

                    <p>
                        The tool was for conjunction visualization; I created both still frames and animations showing satellite conjunction events, displaying features such as the probability density function clouds (for both absolute and relative position views), the collision sphere, the conjunction plane, and the predicted covariance ellipse.
                        I later adapted these visualization tools to be highly customizable and modular; each aspect of the animation (pausing, zooming, panning, labeling/displaying features, etc.) is very easy to manipulate.
                        CARA plans to use the tools I have developed to illustrate conjunction events to mission teams who require conjunction analysis, as well as to individuals who are unfamiliar with conjunction analysis as a tutorial.
                        As part of this internship, I have gained extensive exposure to various facets of astrodynamics, both in practical and theoretical aspects of the field itself (<em>i.e.</em>, element set/reference frame/time system conversions, two line element sets, orbit shapes/parameters/maneuvers, precession/nutation, <em>etc.</em>) and more generally applicable topics (<em>i.e.</em>, covariance/error, MATLAB unit testing, engineering practices, <em>etc.</em>).
